Please start by downloading yahoo datasets from the link provided and run the file 'sample.py' which contains implementation of support sampling algorithm, with the downloaded datasets.
There is data file for synthetic datasets as well.
The rest three files are the implemntations of Frequent item mining, Survery Sampling and Heavy Hitter finding algorithms. 
We have hardcoded them with the synthetic datasets as they were taking a lot of time just for reading on the 2.2GB yahoo data.
